    <h1>The History of Minecraft</h1>
      <p>In The "pre-classic" period, only Notch and a couple of private testers from various IRC channels played and tested the game.</p>
      <p>Originally users would play the game as a java applet at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090627014206/http://www.mojang.com:80/notch/minecraft">http://www.mojang.com/notch/minecraft</a> but Notch quickly moved the game to minecraft.net</p>
      <p>Notch uploaded a few videos in this time period, the videos eventually got geographically blocked in around 2017.</p>
      <p>Paul Eres names the game "Minecraft: Order of The Stone" but notch quickly shortens it to just "Minecraft". There were various other suggestions for the name that never got used. (Though "Order of The Stone" was later used as a name for a Minecraft spinoff game made by Teltale Games)</p>
      <p>During the early classic period TIG user Evil-Ville was the earliest known person to record a video during this time, recording version 0.0.9 but the video and channel both got deleted in some time around 2011. Evil-Ville was contacted but the video was not recovered, he did describe the contents in the video that matched a 0.0.9 screenshot posted in the IRC.</p>
     

      <h1>May 13th, 2009, 16:48:38 UTC:</h1>
      <p>Date developed: May 10 - May 11/May 13, 2009</p>
      <p>Version: rd-131648</p>
      <h3><a href="#notch">Notch</a> discusses the game (then known as Cave Game) in the #LWJGL IRC channel.</h3>  
      <p>rd-131648 is the first unreleased version of Minecraft pre-Classic (then known as Cave Game) created on May
        13, 2009 at 16:48 UTC.[1] This version was never released to the public, and there isn't any footage either.
        Despite the fact that the development of Minecraft began some time before this version, on May 10, 2009 or
        arlier, older testimonies are not considered separate versions, as they were extremely unstable and completely unplayable.</p>

      <h1>May 13th, 2009, 16:48:38 UTC:</h1>
      <p>Date developed: May 10 - May 11/May 13, 2009</p>
      <p>Version: rd-131655</p>
      <p>rd-131655 is the second unreleased version officially known as Cave game tech test [1] or Cave Game tech demo[2]. It was made on May 13, 2009, at 16:55 UTC.[3] This version was never released, but was recorded by Notch from around 17:00 UTC and uploaded at 17:36.[4] It is the earliest known version of Minecraft, or what was then known as Cave Game, to have been recorded.
      Development of these versions started around May 12 at the latest[5] and continued up to May 13, 2009. Features were added that would be later seen in the Cave game tech test video released on May 13, 2009.</p>

      <h2>Additions:</h2>
      <h3>Blocks</h3>
      <p>Air</p>
      <ul><li>Not listed as a block at this time.</li></ul>
      <p>Grass block</p>
      <ul><li>Made with the same graphics from RubyDung.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Its texture at this time would later be repurposed for cobblestone.</li></ul>
      <h3>Non-mob entities</h3>
      <p>Player</p>
      <ul><li>Currently has no model.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Has a height of 1.7 blocks.</li></ul>
      <h3>World generation</h3>
      <p>Chunks</p>
      <ul><li>Take about 1⁄10 of a second to generate.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The size of each chunk was 16×16 blocks.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Chunks are 16×16 blocks instead of 8×8 because 8×8 chunks decreased performance.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Chunks are loaded in order of their proximity to the player.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The player spawns in a 256×64×256 tile map.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The game takes 20 seconds to generate a 256×64×256 map.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>It was possible to fall out of the world, but it would not kill the player.</li></ul>
      <p>Caves</p>
      <ul><li>Reached down until a few blocks before the last layer of cobblestone, making a ravine.</li></ul>
      <h3>General</h3>
      <p>Lighting</p>
      <ul><li>The lighting engine in Classic and Pre-Classic was simple, with only 2 light levels, bright and dark. "Sunlight" is emitted by the top edge of the map and hits any block that is under it, regardless of distance. It passes through transparent blocks to light blocks underneath. Blocks that do not receive light are in a dim shadow that remains at the same level of brightness no matter how far they are from a light source. Blocks which are darkened also have a layer of thick, black fog applied to them, appearing darker when looked at from further distances.[verify] This caused weird visual glitches.</li></ul>
      <p>Creative mode</p>
      <ul><li>This was an extremely basic version of it. The player could not fly or place/remove blocks and there was no inventory or hotbar to get them from.</li></ul>
      <p>Respawning</p>
      <ul><li>The player can respawn by pressing R, teleporting them to the world they were in.</li></ul>

      <h1>May 13th, 2009, 20:11:XX UTC:</h1>
      <p>Date Developed: May 13, 2009</p>
      <p>Version: rd-132211</p>
      <p>The first released pre-Classic version was made on May 13, 2009, at 20:11 UTC.[1] It is the oldest version available in the Minecraft launcher and the current oldest archived version of Minecraft. The copy in the launcher is recompiled from source code, with dates edited to May 13, 2009, making it technically not original.</p>
      <h2>Additions:</h2>
      <h3>Blocks</h3>
      <ul><li>Placing and destroying blocks: Left-clicking places a block. Right-clicking destroys a block.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Blocks cannot be placed past the existing border.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Players can place blocks on the space they are occupying.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Added a flashing white overlay that displays on the side of a block that the player has their mouse over.</li></ul>
      <h3>General</h3>
      <ul><li>The level can be saved by pressing "Enter".</li></ul>
      <ul><li>It will also save when closing the game.</li></ul>
      <h2>Changes:</h2>
      <h3>Blocks</h3>
      <ul><li>Block types are handled depending upon where they are located within the world, as opposed to later versions where any block can be placed anywhere. Blocks at the same level as grass block turn to grass blocks and blocks at the same level as stone or air turn to stone.</li></ul>
      <h3>World generation</h3>
      <ul><li>Level generation improved to be not so messy and random (as shown in the Cave game tech test video), but instead completely flat.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The World generated is a cuboid of 256×256×42 blocks, with a maximum height of y=64.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The world is full of stone up to y=41, only grass at y=42 and nothing for the remaining part.</li></ul>
      <h2>Trivia:</h2>
      <ul><li>The "rd" before the version number old_alpha rd-132211 stands for RubyDung, a game Notch was working on before Minecraft, whose codebase was later reused for Minecraft.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Holding down R causes the player to cycle rapidly through respawn locations above the level until it is released.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Level data is saved in a single level.dat file inside the launcher folder, unlike future versions which have dedicated folders.</li></ul>

      <h1>May 13th, 2009, at 21:28:XX UTC:</h1>
      <p>Date developed: May 13, 2009</p>
      <p>Version: rd-132328</p>
      <p>rd-132328 is a pre-Classic version made on May 13, 2009, at 21:28 UTC.[1] It is available in the launcher. The copy in the launcher is recompiled from source code, with dates edited to May 13, 2009, making it technically not original.</p>
      <img src="images/rd-132328/Human_Mob.jpg" alt="">
      <h2>Additions:</h2>
      <h3>Mobs</h3>
      <p>Mobs</p>
      <ul><li>Run randomly around the map with no proper AI or movement animation.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The first mob to be added into the game.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>100 spawn at random positions upon world generation and loading.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Does not save into the level.dat file</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Once the world is closed and reopened, all mobs previously there would have despawned and new ones would spawn in.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Reused from Zombie Town, an abandoned project made by Notch before Minecraft.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Are referred to as zombies in the code.</li></ul>
      <h2>Trivia</h2>
      <ul><li>This version contains unused functionality that will cause the player to slowly rise up to ground level if they spawn under the world. However, it is not possible to spawn under the world without modding, hence why it is unused.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The "rd" before the version number stands for RubyDung, a game Notch was working on before Minecraft, whose codebase was later reused for Minecraft.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The oldest publicly known Minecraft world level is for this version. <a href="dl/level.dat">(ez's level.dat)</a></li></ul>

      <p>Release date: May 15th, 2009.</p>
      <p>Version: rd-160052</p>
      <p>rd-160052 is a pre-Classic version made on May 15, 2009, at 22:52 UTC.[1][note 1] It is available in the launcher. The copy in the launcher is recompiled from source code, with dates edited to March 2009, making it technically not original. Additionally, it appears to be tampered with further in order to make the game run in fullscreen by default.</p>
      <h2>Additions:</h2>
      <h3>Non-mob entities</h3>
      <h3>Particles</h3>
      <ul><li>Added "block particle" entities.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>They appear when blocks are broken.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Fall to the ground before disappearing.</li></ul>
      <h3>Bugs</h3>
      <ul><li>When alt-tabbing the GUI disappears (Linux).</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Rendering glitches occur every so often over time, due to misaligned vertex arrays.</li></ul>
      <h2>Trivia</h2>
      <ul><li>The name of the game is changed from "Minecraft: Order of the Stone" to simply just "Minecraft".</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The "rd" before the version number stands for RubyDung, a game Notch was working on before Minecraft, whose codebase was later reused for Minecraft.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>When taking a screenshot with PrintScreen, it will take a screenshot of the frame that the program first showed on the screen. Each time the player runs or alt-tabs into the program, it updates that image in memory. When the player hits print screen, it doesn't take what's shown on the player's screen, but for some reason pulls it from that memory.</li></ul>

      <p>Release date: May 16th, 2009</p>
      <p>Version: rd-161348</p>
      <p>rd-161348 is a pre-Classic version made on May 16, 2009, at 11:48 UTC</p>
      <p>A version called "rd-161348" is available in the launcher. However, it is recompiled from source code with dates edited to March 2009 and also contains a terrain.png from Classic version 0.0.13a and signature files from 2013.</p>
      <p>This version is duplicated in the launcher, as attempting to play rd-20090515 will instead download rd-161348</p>
      <h2>Additions:</h2>
      <h3>Blocks</h3>
      <p>Saplings</p>
      <ul><li>Pressing 6 will select it.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>It was not on 5, and nothing was on it, as Notch disliked the texture, trying to hide it</li></ul>
      <h3>Blocks</h3>
      <p>Wood planks</p>
      <ul><li>Pressing 6 will select it.</li></ul>
      <h3>World Generation</h3>
      <ul><li>Cliffs are now much more common.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Objects in the distance appear a tiny bit darker.</li></ul>
      <h3>Texture</h3>
      <ul><li>The launcher variant of this version uses textures from later versions.</li></ul>
      <h3>Gameplay</h3>
      <ul><li>Particles now follow the player's location (a player facing up will see the full particle rather than a sliver of the side).</li></ul>
      <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
      <ul><li>Made the crosshair graphic thicker.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The block preview in the top-right corner of the screen has been flipped.</li></ul>
      <h2>Fixes</h2>
      <ul><li>Fixed rendering glitch where the world became invisible at certain angles.</li></ul>
      <h2></h2>
      <h2>Trivia</h2>
      <ul><li>The terrain.png file for this version is dated May 21, 2009 03:02 UTC+2[note 1] (in Sweden), which is after this version was released. The textures in this version are replaced with ones from Classic 0.0.13a.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Classic 0.0.14a_08 was released on May 28, 2009 and Classic 0.0.13a was released May 22, 2009.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The terrain.png in Classic 0.0.13a is bit-for-bit identical to the one in this version.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The "rd" before the version number stands for RubyDung, a game Notch was working on before Minecraft, whose codebase was later reused for Minecraft</li></ul>
      <ul><li>This is the last version to use this.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>This is the first version that has been duplicated in the launcher.</li></ul>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>The char.png and terrain.png files in the launcher's variant of this version have last-modified times of 21:25:46 and 03:03:00, respectively, in UTC+3. In char.png and terrain.png files from nearby versions that are identical to those in rd-161348, their last-modified times are exactly an hour earlier, i.e. UTC+2. Since time zone changes do not affect jar file contents, the launcher's rd-161348 is a repackage of the original rd-161348, during which a time zone change affected its loose files.</p>
      <p>The variant of rd-161348 from the launcher uses textures from Classic 0.0.13a, so its sapling texture is Oak Sapling JE2.png.</p>

      <p>i think i'm the person that named this game (in irc, we kept throwing out names and you liked minecraft)</p>
      <p>anyway, my experience with this game is that i only played it once: i dug myself really really deep into the earth in a single hole, and couldn't jump out so i got scared. it took me like half an hour to dig myself back out, and was amazed to see sunlight again. after that i was so relieved to be out of that hole and so scared of getting myself trapped in such a place again that i had to leave the game in triumph.</p>

      <p>The start of a village I built in Minecraft, plus some cave exploring. I wrote a story, about a traveler coming to visit the valley, but I had much more of the village and an extensive castle still to build. I got sick of keeping firefox open to preserve my work, so I recorded this as a sort of first draft. Maybe when Minecraft has a save option and multiplayer I will finish. The caves and the terrain were all as generated by the game.</p>

      <p>Some video footage of the very first multiplayer test of Minecraft - so awesome it caused the server to explode, triggering a power blackout in a 50-mile radius around Notch's home!</p>
      <p>Sorry not to have more coverage of what people were building. I was a little busy with my own traditional circular tower, and before I had chance to do a proper walkaround of what people had built, the blackout struck :(</p>
      <p>The test lasted slightly over 30mins with a few crashes and restarts along the way - it was frantic, and incredible to see so much being built (and destroyed - silly griefers) in such a short time!</p>
      <p>Thanks to everyone who took part, especially Notch for the continued fantastic work!</p>
